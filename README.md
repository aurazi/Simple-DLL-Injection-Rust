# Simple-DLL-Injection-Rust

Basic implementation of DLL injection using LoadLibrary through kernel32.dll, using the knowledge I've gained from my previous repository and a couple sources credited in the main.rs file.
There is also Thread Hijacking which just has a shellcode that calls LoadLibrary, its basically an overengineered version
of the default injection method.

Created for educational purposes.
